  "body": "matCOMBISTEPS is a collection programs (m-files) to load, process, and manipulate data produced by IONIC software.\r\n\r\nmatCOMBISTEPS uses GNU Octave (or Matlab) as a base (these are powerful number crunching programs, which provide a huge toolbox of routines for data analysis and processing). matCOMBISTEPS therefore provides a convenient and flexible method for processing data obtained from IONIC. In addition, the matCOMBISTEPS tools may be used to write user-defined scripts and functions for elaborate and customised data processing.\r\n\r\nmatCOMBISTEPS is distributed as free software under the GNU General Public License (see LICENSE.txt).\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2015 Matthias S.
